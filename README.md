# Phishing_Detection_Extension

This is a google chrome extension that I completed for my Dissertation at the University of Essex. 

This extension explores and attempts to answer the question: Does Education Prevent Phishing? 

The extension utilizes a random forest model algorithm trained to look for 17 key features from [UC Irvine's Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites)
